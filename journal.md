# Introduction
We prsent here aircraft measurements of SOA of Nigeria, using and Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan, 2004).
Joe Bloggs has already made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the major important questions yet.
Haywood et al (2000) did some very great aircraft based measurements in their paper on the Sahel, focussing on radiative forcings.
